# fluent-plugin-append_kubernetes_labels_to_tag

## A Fluent plugin to add kubernetes container labels to the log tag

## Prerequisites

This plugin is intended for use with the [kuberenetes_metadata_filter](https://github.com/fabric8io/fluent-plugin-kubernetes_metadata_filter) plugin. You will need to filter with `kubernetes_metadata_filter` so that your log records have the `kubernetes` attribute loaded with the required data.

## TODO

### Open source this gem
  * [x] Stop relying on a Redbubble-owned Docker image for the build
  * [ ] Publish to Rubygems.org
  * [ ] Make repo public

## Usage

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fluent-plugin-append-kubernetes-labels-to-tag'
```

In your Fluent config:

```
<filter **>
  @type kubernetes_metadata_filter # See 'Prerequisites' above
  
  ...
  
</filter>

<filter **>
  @type append_kubernetes_labels_to_tag
  
  labels ['log_destination']
</filter>
```
